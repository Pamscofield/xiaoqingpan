## Denisovan first discovered in 2008

Archaeology is interesting, human archaeology is extremly interesting.

I guess the story begins in 2008 that archaeologist from Novosibirsk institute (Michael Shunkov, et al) dug up a fossile of human finger bone in a **Denisova Cave** in the Altai Mountains (阿尔泰山) in southern Siberia and just simply assumed that it might be of of Neanderthals (*Homo neanderthalensis*) who left it between 30,000 and 48,000 years ago [^1]. 

Later, a team from **Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology** in Leipzig (Johannes Krause, et al) got the fossile and sequenced the mtDNA and found out it didn't match to Neanderthals [^2]. They named it **Denisovan** in the end since it was found in a denisova cave. 

It's the fourth Homo species found, followed after *Homo sapiens* (modern humans), *Homo neanderthalensis* (Neanderthals), *Homo floresiensis*, which was found in Indonesia in 2003. 

A few more relevant old studies: 

- *Homo floresiensis*, which was found in Indonesia in 2003
- *Homo erectus* is the ancestor of later human species, including *H. heidelbergensis* — the last common ancestor of modern humans, Neanderthals, and Denisovans.

It's kind of sad that people who found the fossile or say people who are from that region didn't define it. I actually cried immediately when reading *"When the finger bone was discovered, "we didn't pay special attention to it", says archaeologist Michael Shunkov of the Novosibirsk institute."*

## More findings came after this pioneer research

Nine months later, the same team from Leipzig, Germany demonstrated that Denisovans were a sister group to the Neanderthals, which lived in Europe and western Asia. They found a molar tooth, which was extremly large (see below)

In 2025, a group from Denmark has demonstrated that **Denisovans** were not just found in cold regions like Siberia and Tibet, but also in Penghu, Taiwan (台湾澎湖岛) [^3]. It is the first time **Denisovans** were found in warm climates. The way they identified was to use  ancient proteomic analysis on a previously unidentified hominin mandible.
