<p>It’s kind of funny that my summer vacation is some volunteer activities. First is by the end of May (22.05.2025 - 26.05.2025), five days shifts for setup, and just magically miss the real <a href="https://www.turnfest.de/en/faqs"><strong>Das Turnfest 2025</strong></a> German National Gymnastics competition.</p>

<p>Second one is <a href="https://www.rhineruhr2025.com/en"><strong>FISU WORLD UNIVERSITY GAMES</strong></a>. The shift schedule is not out yet, but I’m pretty excited about that.</p>
