## Denisovan first discovered in 2008

Archaeology is interesting, human archaeology is extremly interesting.

I guess the story begins in 2008 that archaeologist from Novosibirsk institute (Michael Shunkov, et al) dug up a fossile of human finger bone in a **Denisova Cave** in the Altai Mountains (阿尔泰山) in southern Siberia and just simply assumed that it might be of of Neanderthals (*Homo neanderthalensis*) who left it between 30,000 and 48,000 years ago. 

Later, a team from **Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology** in Leipzig (Johannes Krause, et al) got the fossile and sequenced the mtDNA and found out it didn't match to Neanderthals[^1]. They named it **Denisovan** in the end since it was found in a denisova cave. 

It's kind of sad that people who found the fossile or say people who are from that region didn't define it. But hey, it's science. 

## More findings came after this pinoeer research

Nine months later, the same team from Leipzig, Germany demonstrated that Denisovans were a sister group to the Neanderthals, which lived in Europe and western Asia. They found a molar tooth, which was extremly large (see below)
