Some common knowledge first:
- *Absidia corymbifera* is *Lichthemia corymbifera*.
- *Rhizopus delemar* is *Rhizopus oryzae* is *Rhizopus arrhizus*.
- granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) also known as colony-stimulating factor 2 (CSF2) a monomeric glycoprotein secreted by macrophages, T cells, mast cells, natural killer cells, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts that functions as a **cytokine**. GM-CSF facilitates development of the immune system and promotes defense against infections.

## What fungi can induce interferon (IFN)?   
As it's already known, that *Aspergillus fumigatus* and some *Candida* species can induce IFN. *Mucor* species (e.g., *R. oryzae* or *L. corymbifera*) has not been reported to induce IFN.
- Interferons, especially type I and III, play critical roles in antifungal immunity.
- ***A. fumigatus* and IFN**: Dectin-1-mediated recognition of β-glucan on the cell wall of the clinically relevant fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus promotes the activation of a protective cascade of type I and III interferon expression [^1].
- ***C. albicans* and IFN**: 1) Type I IFN pathway is induced in PBMCs ad plays a central role during infections [^2]. 2) *C. albicans* can suppress nitric oxide production by IFN-γ and LPS-stimulated macrophages, which may help the fungus evade the immune system


## What is known about *Mucor* and IFN?
*Mucor* has not been reported to induce INF response, but one study incubated polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs)  with IFN-γ for 22 h [^1], and the result showed:  
- the coincubation increased the PMNL-induced hyphal damage of *R. oryzae*, *R. microsporus* and *L. corymbifera*. 
- Coincubation of PMNLs with IFN-γ and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)increased the release of tumor necrosis factor–α in response to *R. microsporus* and *L. corymbifera* hyphae. 
- IFN-γ significantly reduced interleukin-8 release in response to all zygomycetes.
- *Rhizopus* species demonstrate a decreased susceptibility to the antifungal activity of human PMNLs, in comparison with *L. corymbifera*.
