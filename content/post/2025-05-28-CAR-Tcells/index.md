I have applied two postdoc positions about CAR T cells last month but neither of them replied. Well, to be fair I don't know much about it. So... 

Let's have a look at what is new about CAR T cells then.

From [Nature Feature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01570-6), I only see the money!! It says CAR-T therapy is expected US$1 billion in 2025, and will grow to ~$190 billion in 2034.  

Some facts that you should know about CAR-T cells:  
- chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell
- CAR-T therapy is treatments that engineer a person's own immune cells to attack cancer cells.
- Previously, CAR-T cells in the lab was considered time-consuming and of course, expensive.
- Now scientists / companies are working on it. 
- It's one of the most powerful therapies to treat many types of blood cancers (**only blood cancers**).
