**Title**: A symbiotic filamentous gut fungus ameliorates MASH via a secondary metabolite–CerS6–ceramide axis


- A lab from Peking University has demonstrated that human gut fungus *Fusarium foetens* produces a molecule that reduces symptoms of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in mice [^1]. 
- Filamentous fungi are frequently found in the human gut.
- The study marks a step forward in improving treatments for the disease, which affects roughly 30% of adults worldwide.

**Title**: The Candida albicans exotoxin candidalysin promotes alcohol-associated liver disease


- A study from 2020 has already shown that gut yeast *Candida albicans* worsen alcoholic fatty liver disease via candidalysin [^2], which is the opposite of the first study. 
- One of Prof. Dr. Hube's work.
